Time Encoding and Decoding Toolbox
==================================

Introduction
------------

The Time Encoding and Decoding Toolbox (TED) is a library of Python
routines, classes, and demo programs that implement time encoding and
decoding algorithms. A  
`MATLAB <http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/>`_  implementation of the
toolbox is also available from the Bionet Group's `code repository page
<http://bionet.github.com/>`_.  

To get started using the toolbox, go to the :doc:`installation <install>` page and
try running the demos. Check out the :doc:`overview <overview>` page for a
high-level introduction to time encoding and decoding concepts.
