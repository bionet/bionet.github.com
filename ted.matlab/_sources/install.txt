Installation Instructions
=========================

Prerequisites
-------------

The Time Encoding and Decoding Toolbox requires several software
packages to be present in order to be installed (newer versions of
these packages may also work).

* `MATLAB R14 <http://www.mathworks.com/>`_
* `Bionet MATLAB Utilities 0.016 <http://bionet.github.com/>`_

To build the documentation, the following Python packages are also
required:

* `Docutils <http://docutils.sourceforge.net>`_ 0.5 or later.
* `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org>`_ 1.0.1 or later.
* `Jinja2 <htt://jinja.pocoo.org>`_ 2.2 or later
* `Pygments <http://pygments.org>`_ 0.8 or later

Building and Installation
-------------------------

Unpack the archive into an installation directory of your
choice. Assuming that Matlab is installed in the directory whose name
is stored in the environmental variable ``$MATLAB``, one may wish to
install the software in ``$MATLAB/toolbox/ted`` if one has
administrative access to the machine.

Add the subdirectories of the installation directory to Matlab's
search path so that the functions comprised by the toolbox may be
easily accessed. For example, if the software is installed in
``$MATLAB/toolbox/ted``, one may add the following lines to the list of
paths in ``$MATLAB/toolbox/local/pathdef.m`` and restart Matlab to make 
the toolbox contents available:

   matlabroot,'/toolbox/ted/ted:', ...
   matlabroot,'/toolbox/ted/teddemos:', ...

Alternatively, one may also add the path to the toolbox for the
duration of one session by running the commands

   addpath(strcat(getenv('MATLAB'),'/toolbox/ted/ted'));
   addpath(strcat(getenv('MATLAB'),'/toolbox/ted/teddemos'));

To rebuild the documentation, run::

   make

from within the ``doc/`` subdirectory and follow the directions.
