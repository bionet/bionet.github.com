Time Encoding and Decoding Toolbox
==================================

Introduction
------------
The Time Encoding and Decoding Toolbox (TED) is a library of MATLAB 
functions and demos that implement time encoding and decoding algorithms. 
A `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_/`PyCUDA <http://mathema.tician.de/software/pycuda/>`_ 
implementation is also available from the Bionet Group's 
`code repository page <http://bionet.github.com/>`_. 

To get started using the toolbox, go to the :doc:`installation <install>` page and 
try running the demos. Check out the :doc:`machines <machines>` page for a 
high-level description of the time encoding and decoding routines included in
the toolbox.
